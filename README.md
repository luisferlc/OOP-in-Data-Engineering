# Goal of the project
Utilize OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Python to create a data pipeline that grabs data from a PostgreSQL database, save CSV files locally and then upload those files to AWS S3. 
I have found that there is little content out there regarding the use of OOP into Data Engineeting. Most of the cases I have found that the gold standard principles of Software Engineering can be adapted to 
Data Engineering, and that is why I made this.
